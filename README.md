This program is designed to operate using the following components:

Python Version:
The program requires Python version 3.12, which is bundled.

Required Python Packages:
The program relies on several Python packages to work correctly. You need to have these packages installed if somehow installer missed it or stopped midway:

bottle==0.12.25: A lightweight web framework used by the program.
peewee==3.17.6: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library used for database interactions.
waitress==3.0.0: A WSGI server that serves the programâ€™s web application.

Bundled Components:
The application utilizes Tkinter launcher and PyInstaller for packaging and running as a standalone executable. If you encounter issues with the program, ensure that these components are correctly installed and configured.

Additional Libraries and Tools:
This program also includes CSS and JS libraries for styling and functionality, as well as SQLite for database management. Special thanks to the creators of these libraries and tools, as well as the CDN suppliers.

If the program is not functioning as expected, you may need to verify and work with these components to resolve any issues.
